## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Please NOTE, that we are ignoring NA for this report

```{r stepsmean, results=TRUE}

stepPerDay<-as.data.frame(aggregate(movements$steps, by=list(movements$Dates), FUN=mean))
colnames(stepPerDay) <- c('Date', 'MeanSteps')

plot(stepPerDay$MeanSteps ~ stepPerDay$Date,xlab="", ylab="Steps", pch=19, type = "l", col = "red",main = "Mean steps per day")

```
